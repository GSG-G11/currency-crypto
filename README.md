## **About CurruncyCrypto** :money_with_wings: 


### What?

 CurrencyCrypto is an application where you can see the Cryptocurrencies & their info easily and flexibly. No need to sign in to change the cuurency or too give your personal inforamtion. once you search on a crypto of your choice you get it with its entire specifications.

### Why?

I have invested my money in a specific Cryptocurrency a while ago, and then the local currency crashed and the cryptocurrency price flew off, so I found it hard to know if I am in gain or loss. and based on that problem which faced me in person we came up with the idea of the project.

### How?

#### *Planning Phase:*
- We came up with the concept of the app and gathered content and API that fit our idea.
- We saw some inspiration and the basis of Crypto exange websites.
- we sketched a UI design to work in using Figma.
- And finally we divided up the workload accordingly.

#### *Development Phase:*
- in the first stage we chose what technologies do we need to use (shown below) and how to work in a team.
- we designed the ui using figma then we started dierectly in the HTML/CSS part so we can get done with the static part.
- and after that each one of us got his tasks in javascript and API to apply it.
- after all of that we gathered the whole work on github and made the entire application.


## **User Stories**  :books: 

#### As a User, I can :
- See a general theme of the website when i land first.
- See a slogan of the website and colorful bubbles for beuty.
- Select any currency i would the prices in it.
- Just enter the website to see the prices in dollar.
- see the top 100 cryptocurruncies in the world in a table with their info.
- Search about any Cryptocurrunciew either using its name or symbol.
- Norice if a currency is increasing or decreasing by its color.



## **User Journey**  :pencil2:
 When the user enters the web application landing, he/she can enter it either by submitting a currency or just as regular prices in dollar on his own choice.
 
In either cases the user would be able to see the same view and it just differs with the currency and its value.

After making it to the main page the user search about a specific Cryptocurrency so the top 100 is wiped and new search matches are shown.



## **Features** :stars: 

* Ease of use.
* can select any currency you want.
* show who much is in-use and traded Cryptocurrenceys.
* Displays a brief description about every added Crypto.
* can search about any crypto comes to your mind.
